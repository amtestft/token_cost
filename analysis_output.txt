The dataset contains 10,000 rows with the following relevant columns for SEO analysis:

- `clicks`: Number of organic clicks.
- `impressions`: Number of times the page appeared in search results.
- `ctr`: Click-through rate (clicks / impressions).
- `queries`: Search query term (assumed to be linked to a specific URL).
- `dates`: Date of the query.

However, **URL and keyword position data are missing**, which limits our ability to analyze keyword rankings and page-specific metrics precisely. I’ll proceed by analyzing based on the available data.

Now, I’ll compute:

1. Top 10 queries by traffic volume (clicks).
2. Identify patterns among top queries (e.g., common terms).
3. Spot underperforming queries (low CTR despite high impressions).
4. Recommend improvements based on CTR and clicks.

Let’s go step by step.

Here are the **Top 10 performing queries** based on total clicks. Next, I’ll analyze characteristics of these high-performing queries to identify common traits.

### Common Characteristics of High-Performing Queries

- **Frequent Terms**:  
  High-performing queries often include terms like:
  - `recipes` (5 times)
  - `history`, `lasagna`, `pizza`, `cookbook` (3–4 times each)
  - These suggest a strong interest in content that blends food with historical or curated content.

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Average CTR**: ~3.46%
  - **Average Impressions**: ~63.7 million
  - **High Clicks**: All above 590,000 clicks
  - **Low Variance in Performance**: Most top queries are consistently performing well, showing reliable content interest.

Now, let’s identify underperforming queries with high impressions but low CTR and clicks.

### Underperforming Queries – Key Observations

- These queries have **high impressions** (often >15M) but **low CTRs** (mostly <1.3%) and **moderate clicks**.
- Many use the same **key terms** as high performers (`lasagna`, `cookbook`, `best`), suggesting:
  - Possibly **too broad** or **redundant phrasing**
  - Lack of **metadata optimization** or **page targeting**

### Actionable Recommendations

**1. Improve Metadata (Title/Description):**
   - Ensure **meta titles and descriptions** clearly match user intent for underperforming queries.
   - Use high-performing queries as templates for structure and keyword placement.

**2. Refine Content Targeting:**
   - Reassess **search intent**: Are users looking for historical info, step-by-step recipes, or downloadable content?
   - Split generic content into **more specific landing pages**.

**3. Optimize for CTR:**
   - Use **rich snippets** (FAQ, ratings, images) to improve visibility in SERPs.
   - A/B test **headline formats** to boost click engagement.

**4. Consolidate Redundant Pages:**
   - Combine closely related content to avoid **keyword cannibalization** (e.g., multiple pages on “lasagna cookbook”).

**5. Improve Page Experience:**
   - Although not directly analyzed here, ensure **page speed**, **mobile-friendliness**, and **internal linking** are optimized.
