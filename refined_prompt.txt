Analyze the provided SEO dataset to identify the best-performing web pages in terms of organic traffic, click-through rates, and keyword rankings. The analysis should include:

A ranking of the top 10 pages based on traffic volume

Identification of common characteristics among high-performing pages (e.g., content length, keyword density, metadata quality)

A list of underperforming pages with potential reasons (e.g., low keyword relevance, poor loading speed, missing meta tags)

Actionable recommendations to improve visibility and performance of the underperforming pages Present the results in a clear, structured format (e.g., bullet points or short paragraphs). The tone should be analytical and concise. Assume the dataset is recent (last 3 months) and includes metrics such as impressions, clicks, position, URL, and query terms.
